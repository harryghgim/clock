This project is my work of **Bulild a 25 + 5 Clock** project, which is one of five projects to pass [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries) certification maintained by FreeCodeCamp. 

## Purpose
It aims to build a simple timer, which you can use to track working time and break time. 

## Instructions
In the landing page, you will be presented break length, session length, session display time and a few buttons. Press arrow buttons to either increase or decrese minute for break or session. To start couting press play/pause button. To reset minutes and start over, press reset button. Time will be displayed as mm:ss. Couting will continue unless you press pause button. By pressing pause button again couting will go on where it stopped.

On the top left corner is hamburger button to toggle test panel. You can check if my project passes all tests by pressing Run Tests button. There are 29 tests and if every one of them is passed, you will see green sign that says "Tests Passed".
